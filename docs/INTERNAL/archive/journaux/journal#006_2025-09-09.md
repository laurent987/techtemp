# Journal #006 — Application Orchestration (2025-09-09)

## Objective

Implement the **Application Orchestration** to complete the service-app as a production-ready application:
- Main application bootstrap in `src/main.js`
- Complete system lifecycle management (start/stop/graceful shutdown)
- Signal handling and process management
- Configuration loading and validation
- Error handling and recovery strategies

## Context

Journal #005 delivered **complete HTTP Server + REST API**:
- ✅ HTTP Server with Express.js (lifecycle management)
- ✅ Health endpoint with database connectivity testing
- ✅ Readings API conforming to Contract 001
- ✅ Complete MQTT → DB → HTTP integration (158 tests passing)
- ✅ Performance validated (<20ms API response)

Now we need to **orchestrate all components** into a single, production-ready application.

## Decisions

- **Main Application**: `src/main.js` as the single entry point
- **Lifecycle Management**: Graceful startup and shutdown sequences
- **Signal Handling**: SIGTERM/SIGINT for container compatibility
- **Configuration Strategy**: Environment-based with validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and logging
- **Process Management**: Clean resource cleanup and monitoring

## Scope

### ✅ To Implement

**Main Application Bootstrap:**
- `src/main.js`:
  - Configuration loading and validation
  - Database initialization and connection management
  - MQTT client setup and subscription management
  - HTTP server startup with proper error handling
  - Unified lifecycle orchestration

**System Lifecycle Management:**
- Graceful startup sequence with dependency validation
- Proper initialization order: Config → DB → MQTT → HTTP
- Resource health monitoring and startup validation
- Clean shutdown sequence with resource cleanup

**Signal Handling & Process Management:**
- SIGTERM/SIGINT handling for graceful shutdown
- SIGPIPE and other signal management
- Process exit code management
- Container-friendly process behavior

**Error Handling & Recovery:**
- Cross-system error propagation
- Startup failure handling and recovery
- Runtime error monitoring and reporting
- Resource cleanup on failures

**Production Features:**
- Environment-specific configuration loading
- Logging configuration and output management
- Health monitoring and status reporting
- Metrics collection readiness
